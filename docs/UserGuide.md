# AB-3 User Guide

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

Examples:

* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

### Listing all contacts : `list`

Shows a list of all contacts in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Editing a contact : `edit`

Edits an existing contact in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the contact at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the contact will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the contact’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st contact to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd contact to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating contacts by name: `find`

Finds contacts whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Contacts matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

### Deleting a contact, assignment, or class group : `delete`

Deletes the specified contact(s), assignment, or class group from the address book.

**Delete contact(s)**

Format: `delete ct/INDEX [ct/INDEX]…​`

* Deletes the contact(s) at the specified `INDEX` (or multiple indices).
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed contact list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one `ct/INDEX` must be provided.

> **Warning:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Deleted contacts are removed from all class groups and assignments they were allocated to.

Expected output (e.g. `delete ct/2`):
```
Deleted Contact(s): [Alex Yeoh; Phone: 87438807; Email: alexyeoh@example.com; Address: Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40; Tags: [friends]]
```

> **Tip:** Use `find` before deleting to narrow the list and make sure you have the right index. You can also delete multiple contacts at once: `delete ct/1 ct/3 ct/5`.

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete ct/2` deletes the 2nd contact in the displayed list.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete ct/1` deletes the 1st contact in the filtered results.
* `delete ct/1 ct/3` deletes the 1st and 3rd contacts shown in the displayed list.

**Delete assignment**

Format: `delete ass/ASSIGNMENT_NAME`

* Deletes the assignment with the given `ASSIGNMENT_NAME`.
* The name must match exactly (case-sensitive).
* All contact–assignment allocations for this assignment are also removed.

> **Warning:** Deleting an assignment removes it and all its grading records permanently. This cannot be undone.

Expected output (e.g. `delete ass/Assignment 1`):
```
Deleted Assignment: Assignment 1; Deadline: 01-01-2025 23:59
```

> **Tip:** Use `list` to see all assignment names before deleting, so you can copy the exact name.

Examples:
* `delete ass/Assignment 1` deletes the assignment named `Assignment 1`.
* `delete ass/Midterm Exam` deletes the assignment named `Midterm Exam`.

**Delete class group**

Format: `delete c/CLASS_NAME`

* Deletes the class group with the given `CLASS_NAME`.
* The name must match exactly (case-sensitive).
* Deleting a class group removes the grouping only. The contacts that were in the class group are **not** deleted from the address book.

> **Warning:** Deleting a class group is permanent. You will need to recreate the group and re-add contacts if you delete it by mistake.

Expected output (e.g. `delete c/CS2103T-T14`):
```
Deleted Class Group: CS2103T-T14
```

> **Tip:** If you just want to remove a single student from a class group, use `unallocateclass` instead of deleting the entire group.

Examples:
* `delete c/CS2103T-T14` deletes the class group named `CS2103T-T14`.
* `delete c/Tutorial Group A` deletes the class group named `Tutorial Group A`.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
